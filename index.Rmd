### GTA Shelter System - Population in Crisis

<br>
<br>

**Homelessness**, as defined by **C**anadian **O**bservatory on **H**omelessness (**COH**, formerly the Canadian Homelessness Research Network):<br>

>"*describes the situation of an individual, family or community without stable, permanent, appropriate housing, or the immediate prospect, means and ability of acquiring it. It is the result of systemic or societal barriers, a lack of affordable and appropriate housing, the individual/householdâ€™s financial, mental, cognitive, behavioural or physical challenges, and/or racism and discrimination*."**<sup>1</sup>**

The negative social and economic consequences of **homelessness** in Canada are enormous. Homelessness has in fact flourished in past few decades, largely because of a lack of government leadership. The current shelter strategy that "*warehouses*" the poor, keeping them "*out-of-sight*" and "*out-of-mind*", has failed miserably. These types of "*band-aide*" solutions simply do not address the root causes of homelessness. 

>"*In some ways, it is simple: Canada can choose to invest an average of $2 billion annually to save $4 billion, and bolster urban economies, keep hundreds of thousands of Canadians healthy and productive as well as ensure productive futures. Or we can simply continue with the <u>status quo</u> and hope that things correct themselves, although after nearly 15 years since the original 1993 federal retreat from housing, Canada has succeeded mainly in increasing homelessness*."**<sup>2</sup>**

In fact, the current <u>status quo</u> is "*actually really expensive*".**<sup>3</sup>** It is far cheaper and more cost effective to provide homeless people with real housing, as apposed to "*band-aide*" solutions like shelters, hostels, warming centres and other like-minded temporary emergency services. Current evidence based research clearly "*points to the fact that if we do things differently, we not only achieve better social outcomes, but we also save money*."**<sup>3</sup>** Homelessness is estimated to cost the Canadian economy **<a class="one" href="https://www.homelesshub.ca/about-homelessness/homelessness-101/cost-analysis-homelessness">7.05 billion dollars</a>** on an annual basis. 

The chronic lack of safe and affordable housing, along with the growing economic divide between rich and poor, needs to be addressed by all levels of governments. The current scatter-shot approach to mitigating or eliminating homelessness and poverty, which are inextricably linked, has produced little in the way of real positive social/economic change. 

>"*Not repeating past mistakes should at least be a first line of defence...*[such as]*curtailed social assistance...punitively low minimum wage rates...tax incentives that ignore renters and those on social assistance...cutbacks to social services and health*."**<sup>2</sup>**

<br>

<b>About Toronto's Shelter System:</b>
<br>
Information in this report is based on a number of Shelter and Homelessness records that are freely available for download from the City of Toronto's **<a class="one" href="https://open.toronto.ca/">Open Data Portal</a>**. The following is a brief overview of the main datasets analyzed by our group, the **<a class="one" href="https://www.unhousedliberation.ca/">Voices 4 Unhoused Liberation</a>**.<br>
**(i) <a class="one" href="https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/central-intake-calls/">Central Intake</a>** (**CI**)**<sup>4</sup>** is the entry point for persons in need of emergency shelter services. People able to access **CI**'s 24/7 telephone line (416-338-4766 or 1-877-338-3398) can potentially receive a <u>referral</u> to an emergency shelter or other overnight accommodations. This dataset contains records of calls received by **CI**, and the outcomes of those calls (e.g. # unique individuals who contact **CI**, but were not matched to a shelter space each day). All of this information is collected by the city of Toronto's **S**helter **M**anagement **I**nformation **S**ystem (**SMIS**). Callers not matched to an available space that <u>suits their needs</u> remain in the queue until they can be provided a referral, or until the closeout process at the end of the night at 4:00 AM. These daily call counts and <u>outcomes</u> (i.e. **SMIS** assigns codes for various outcomes) are collected and reported on a monthly basis (i.e. monthly updates are published on the 15<sup>th</sup> day of the following month). **CI** uses 13 distinct <u>wrap-up codes</u> to classify the daily calls they receive. Unfortunately, these codes only provide information about the volume and types of calls, and do not contain information about the outcomes of said referrals.
<br>
**(ii)** **<a class="one" href="https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-shelter-system-flow/">Toronto Shelter System Flow</a>** (**TSSF**)**<sup>5</sup>** data is compiled on a monthly basis by the city of Toronto's **S**helter **M**anagement **I**nformation **S**ystem (**SMIS**). These records show the number of people entering (intake) or leaving (outtake) the shelter system. Some of the terms used in these records are listed in **Table 1**. Unfortunately, the current **SMIS** data is limited since it does not include any information about homeless people sleeping outdoors, or homeless people who do not use city funded services that are apart of **SMIS**. Although it is difficult to assess the exact number of homelessness people within the city, the most recent **<a class="one" href="https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/2021-street-needs-assessment-results/">Street Needs Assessment (2021)</a>** suggests that ~18% of city's homeless population are not included in the current data. This is likely an under estimate of its "*true*" size given the severity of the current housing and homelessness problems within the region.**<sup>5</sup>**
<br>
**(iii) <a class="one" href="https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-overnight-service-occupancy-capacity/">Daily Shelter Overnight Service Occupancy</a>** (**DSOSO**)**<sup>6</sup>** records maintained by **SMIS** is compiled on a daily basis. It records the number of people who use overnight shelters and allied services within the **GTA**. The data includes the identify of program operators, as well as the locations and nature of the services they provide.**<sup>6</sup>**<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately there is little information about the amount of funding the city receives and allocates for these different homeless programs and services. The **DSOSO** dataset only mentions **Funding Capacity** within the context of the "*number of beds or rooms that a program is intended* [funded] *to provide*".**<sup>6</sup>** Although there may be a number of reasons why beds or rooms may be temporarily out of service (e.g. repairs, renovations, outbreaks, or pest control) they are not reported. These records also mention **Actual Capacity**, which refers to the "*number of beds or rooms in service and showing as <u>available for occupancy</u> in the SMIS at time of reporting.*" This latter measure is touted as being "*a more effective capacity measure to assess program occupancy rates*". However, the number of <u>unavailable</u> rooms or beds (**Note:** **# UNAVAILABLE BEDS** = **Capacity Funding Bed** - **Capacity Actual Bed**) is arguable a more reliable measure of the number of rooms/beds the currently funded system can and should provide and fill on a daily basis. Unfortunately there appears to be very little oversight of service providers with regards to reducing or eliminating bed/room "*unavailability*", and the draconian nature of service restrictions they impose on their clients.

**Figure 1. Toronto Central Intake Daily Call Totals.** The plotted data, which was taken from the "*Central Intake Call Wrap-Up Codes*" dataset, provides daily counts of calls answered by **Central Intake Centre** (**CIC**). The calls are classified by a caseworker using 13 distinct "*wrap-up*" codes (i.e. describes general nature of the call). These daily **SMIS** records are manually updated on a monthly basis. Although the "*wrap-up*" codes provide information related to the volume and type of calls received, it does not track requests made by unique individuals, nor the ultimate outcomes of referrals.**<sup>4</sup>** Looking at the plotted data it is evident that there has been an overall increase in the number of calls to **CIC**. Unfortunately it appears that few callers were able to successfully obtain a referral for an overnight sleeping or resting space (colour coded). This low success rate has been particularly pronounced within the last 10 months.

**Figure 2. Toronto Central Intake Total Numbers of Daily Unmatched Callers.** The plotted data, taken from the monthly updated "*Central Intake Service Queue*" dataset, provides daily counts of unique individuals who contacted the **CIC** to access an emergency shelter, but were <u>not matched</u> to a shelter space. The **SMIS** <u>service queue</u> caller data details when a bed was requested for a caller seeking a shelter space. An <u>unmatched</u> caller (i.e. person not given a referral to an available space that suits their needs at the time of their call) <u>remains in the queue</u> until either they were are provided a referral, or until "*close-out*" (i.e. 4:00 AM, end of the night). The data only contains three features, namely: (i) date of the call, (ii) total number of **Unmatched Callers**, and (iii) whether the caller phoned once (i.e. **Single Caller**) or multiple times (i.e. **Repeat Caller**).**<sup>4</sup>** Looking at the plotted data it is evident that there has been a steady increase in the number of callers <u>not</u> receiving a referral to an overnight sleeping space or safe shelter despite repeated calls.

**Figure 3. Toronto Shelter System Flow Data Total Numbers.** This plot shows the total number of "*actively*" homeless people according to **SMIS** records. The **TSSF** data is only updated on a monthly basis (e.g. recent March 2024 data was updated on April 15<sup>th</sup>). The data is only based on those people who have used overnight services that are monitored by **SMIS** (i.e. excludes people who sleep outdoors or who use non-**SMIS** homeless services). The changing width of the plotted line reflects the changing dynamics of the homeless population over this 6 year period. Clearly the number of homeless people remains high within the **GTA**. The recent all time high of 11,173 "actively" homeless people for Feb/2024 is currently ebbing somewhat (10,833 Mar/2024). This is perhaps due to the warmer weather as many homeless people often escape the shelter system for safer environs. Although far from complete the **TSSF** records appear (for some unknown reason) to be more extensive than the **DSOSO** records since the latter dataset reports fewer homeless people (i.e. 9,748 for Mar 1<sup>st</sup>, 9,653 for Mar 15<sup>th</sup>, and 9,687 for Mar 31<sup>st</sup> 2024). This discrepancy in the number of homeless people is a bit disconcerting given that both datasets are reportedly based on the same **SMIS** records.

**Figure 4. Demographics of TSSF dataset.** The above plot shows the number of "*actively*" homeless people classified as either **(i)** Chronically homeless, **(ii)** a member of a homeless Family, **(iii)** Indigenous, **(iv)** a non-refugee, **(v)** a refugee, **(vi)** a single adult (> 24 yrs), or a **(vii)** Youth (16-24 yrs) who is not a member of an homeless family. Like **Figure 3**, the changing width of the plotted line reflects the changing dynamics of each homeless group. Currently (Mar 2024) the largest homeless demographic group is single adults (Note: 7266 single adults, or 67.1%, compared to 2555 family members, or 23.6%, and 1012 youths, or 9.3%). Adults (> 24 yrs) also make up ~77% (4835/6288) of the chronic homeless population. The homeless refugee population (5805, or 53.6%) slightly out numbers the homeless non-refugee population (5028, or 46.4%).

**Figure 8. Homeless Demographics within the GTA Region.** The above graph looks at some homeless demographics within the **GTA**. The number of individuals within each of the designated homeless groups (i.e. **men**, **women**, **families**, **Youth** and **Mixed adults**) have rapidly increased over the last 3 years. Also, the size of the **Mixed adult** population has fluctuated quite dramatically over the past two years. Possible reasons for this may be due to the fluctuating number of designated "*mixed adult*" shelter spaces. For example, some service providers, like Homes First, are unilaterally transitioning some of their shelter spaces (e.g. Delta Hotel Shelter, Scarborough) to a select homeless population (i.e. refugee only) at the expense of other homeless people (i.e. non-refugees mixed adult population). Note that the fate of the Delta non-refugee homeless population has largely being determined by Ward 22 councillor Nick Mantas, who's NIMBY motion to rid the Delta shelter of non-refugee residents was passed by Toronto City Council meeting back in Feb 2024.

**Figure 9. Homeless Population Program Model.** The above graph looks at the designated **Emergency** and **Transitional** shelter programs within the **GTA**. According to City of Toronto's **Housing + Homelessness Service Glossary (2019)<sup>7</sup>** the **Emergency Shelter Program** constitutes a homeless shelter program that individuals and families can access without a referral. By contrast a **Transitional Shelter Program** constitutes a homeless program that individuals and families can access <u>only</u> with a <u>referral</u>. The plotted **DSOSO** data clearly shows that only ~1 out of every 10 homeless individuals have been able to access a <u>referral</u>. This poor referral rate is also evident from the data plotted in **Figure 1** and **Figure 2**.

**Figure 11. Homeless Program Area within the GTA.** Homeless programs can be categorized as either: **(i) Base Shelter**, **(ii) Base Program - Refugee**, **(iii) Temporary Refugee Response**, **(iv) COVID-19 Response**, or **(v) Winter Response**. Generally they can be classified as either regular (i.e. year-round) or temporary programs. The rising numbers of homeless refugees and along with the long-term health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be driving the growing homeless population within the **GTA**. Even the cyclic **Winter Response** program, which normally spikes during the cold season, experienced a considerable rise in the number of homeless people during the last winter season.

**Figure 12 & 13. Homes First's Delta Hotel Shelter.** These two graphs show the number of rooms at the Delta Hotel Shelter that are either occupied (**Figure 12**) or unoccupied (**Figure 13**). Although the number of occupants have been steadily decreasing between Feb 5<sup>th</sup> to April 4<sup>th</sup>, the recent influx of refugees has rapidly corrected these falling numbers. The rapid changes in the number of people sheltered at the Delta Hotel over the past 2 months is also reflected in the number of unavailable rooms at the Delta shelter (**Figure 13**). The fitted **Loess** (**LO**cal regr**ESS**ion) curve is fairly <u>well defined</u> (i.e. residuals are fairly constant over the chosen range of x values), which suggests "*real*" trends in the data (e.g. rapid increase in # unavailable rooms between Feb 5th and April 4th, followed by a quick reversal of this trend between April 4th to present). Nevertheless, it is important to note that the overnight **Delta Hotel Shelter** (Program ID 16011) supervised by **Homes First** is, according to **DSOSO** records, a <u>designated</u> mixed adult (Sector) shelter that falls under the emergency COVID-19 Program. So it is by definition <u>not</u> a refugee-only shelter space. According to **Homes First**, which runs many other additional shelter and supportive housing sites, their mission is to "*develop and provide affordable, stable housing and support services to break the cycle of homelessness for people with the fewest housing options*". However, despite the continuing rise in the number of homeless persons in Toronto (**Fig. 3**,**5**,**8**,**9**), as well as the recent influx of Federal dollars (**<a class="one" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/asylum-seeker-shelter-funding-toronto-1.7102849">$162 million</a>**) to support the Toronto shelter system, **Homes First** has unilaterally decided to transition the **Delta** Hotel Shelter to a refugee only space (i.e. no consultations with residents). Apparently, in accordance with the wishes of local Ward 22 councillor Nick Mantas, the shelter is actively trying to move or evict people from the safety of the shelter. Many have already faced punitive "*service restrictions*" without any appeals process. Even the recent updated appeals process typically results in the eviction of the client at the end of the restriction period. It is important to note that during the time it takes to resolve the appeal process the client is removed from the shelter and forced to find accommodations on their own (i.e. left homeless). Homes First's exclusion of the Delta residents from any decision making process, one that directly impacts their immediate and future well being, is both imprudent and overtly punitive in nature. Many residents are afraid that they will be forced to move back onto the streets, or to some unsafe open congregate shelter space. The non-transparent nature of this decision making process has only heightened the homeless residents' fears, anxiety and distrust of Homes First. This situation has only been exacerbated by the lack of available housing workers who are suppose to be working with the Delta's homeless residents. The current drive to transition the Delta hotel to a refugee-only shelter, at the expense of the non-refugee homeless population, is perplexing given the recent influx of Federal dollars into the Toronto shelter system.
