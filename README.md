# GTAShelterSystem - Population in Crisis

This site is part of **<a href="https://www.unhousedliberation.ca/about">Voices 4 Unhoused Liberation</a>**, an activist community based group dedicated to eradicating homelessness and insecure housing within the **G**reater **T**oronto **A**rea (**GTA**). Towards this goal we have recently analyzed current **GTA** Shelter system records to gain a better understanding of the breadth of homelessness within the **GTA**. Our analysis can be found at: **<a href="https://sheltervoicesto.github.io/GTAShelterSystem/">ShelterVoicesTO</a>**
